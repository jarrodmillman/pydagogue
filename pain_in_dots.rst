Pain in the dots

git_ uses a two and three dot notation for ``git log`` and ``git diff``.

Unfortunately they mean different, and nearly opposite things, in the two cases.

See :ref:`git-log-dots` for the explanation of ``git log`` and dots.  See
:ref:`git-diff-dots` for the ``git diff`` explanation.

See `git log and git diff
<http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Getting_Started_With_Git#Git_Diff_and_Git_Log>`_
for a good explanation.
